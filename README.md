Programming I Assignment 5
1.Write an application that uses an array data structure to store 12 numerical values entered by the uses. Each of these values represents the amount of rainfall for a particular month of the year. The application should declare and create the array and then pass it to a method called populateArray, which takes input from the user and inserts it into the array. The application should then pass the array to a method called calculateAverage, which will calculate and return the average rainfall for the 12 months entered. The average should then be displayed and the output should resemble the following:
2.Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and also has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
The algorithm works as follows:
1)Find the minimum value in the list
2)Swap it with the value in the first position
3)Repeat the steps above for the remainder of the list (starting at the second position and advancing each time)
You are required to create an application, which creates an unsorted array and passes it to a selection sort method for sorting. The application should also contain a method to display the array before and after sorting. Your output should resemble the following:
